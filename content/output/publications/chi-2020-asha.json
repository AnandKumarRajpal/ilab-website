  "abstract": "We are interested in the ways pedestrians will interact with autonomous vehicle (AV) in a future AV transportation ecosystem, when nonverbal cues from the driver such as eye movements, hand gestures, etc. are no longer provided. In this work, we examine a subset of this challenge: interaction between pedestrian with reduced mobility (PRM) and AV. This study explores interface designs between AVs and people in a wheelchair to help them interact with AVs by conducting a preliminary design study. We have assessed the data collected from the study using qualitative analysis and presented different findings on AV-PRM interactions. Our findings reflect on the importance of visual interfaces, changes to the wheelchair and the creative use of the street infrastructure.",
