  "abstract": "Immersive Analytics is a quickly evolving field that unites severalareas such as visualisation, immersive environments, and human-computer interaction to support human data analysis with emergingtechnologies. This research has thrived over the past years withmultiple workshops, seminars, and a growing body of publications,spanning several conferences. Given the rapid advancement ofinteraction technologies and novel application domains, this paper aims toward a broader research agenda to enable widespreadadoption. We present 17 key research challenges developed overmultiple sessions by a diverse group of 24 international experts,initiated from a virtual scientific workshop at ACM CHI 2020. Thesechallenges aim to coordinate future work by providing a systematicroadmap of current directions and impending hurdles to facilitateproductive and effective applications for Immersive Analytics.",
