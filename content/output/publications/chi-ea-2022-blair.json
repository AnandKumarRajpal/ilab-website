  "abstract": "Art is not Research. Research is not Art. is a multimedia, multi-site participatory installation by a collective of artists and researchers from Calgary, Toronto, and Lancaster; it is informed by these contexts. It reflects the tensions between how “participants” are treated in participatory art and interaction research. It offers a framework through which we can explore how epistemologies might evolve in a blending between Art and Research. Visitors download the paper to read, critically reflect on the relationship between art and research, and experientially engage with the material through a series of creative prompts. A performance variation of the piece will be performed in-person and online through the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems alt.chi track.",
